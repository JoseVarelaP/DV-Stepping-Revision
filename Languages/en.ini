[OptionExplanations]

AllowMultipleModels=(CAN CAUSE PERFORMANCE ISSUES)\n\nThis enables the background to load more than one model at a time. Positioning depends on the stage selected.
CurrentStageLighting=Change the setting if the current stage will automaticly cycle during the time of day or manually set it to your liking.
CurrentStageLocation=Select a stage that will be set as the theme's background.\n\n(Locations with (+P) indicate that they might cause perfomance issues.)
ModelsInRoom=Adjust the ammount of models that will appear on the room. You can set a maximum of 5.
DedicatedCharacterShow=Enables the Dedicated Character Show that shows in Gameplay.\n\nIt is extremely experimental right now, and feedback on this feature will be greatly appreciated!

ShowCharactersOnHome=Select if characters should be shown on the Main Menu.
Dedicated Character Settings=Access settings for the Dedicated Character Show in Gameplay.
EnableRandomSongPlay=Enables the theme's ability to pick a random song from your SM Songs library and plays it as the menu's music.\n\nNot the best implementation in the world, but it's ok I guess.
FolderToPlayRandomMusic=Select a folder that it will play its music from.
ShowRandomSongBackground=Choose if the random song's background will softly show up in the menu.\n\nWhen there's no stage or character loaded, it diffuses to half. If there is, then by a forth.

DediModelBPM=(EXPERIMENTAL)\n\nAllows the model to pause its animation during a stop. This is a little unstable so trying to fast foward or slow down the game freezes the model.
DediSongData=Shows a bit of song info at the beginning of gameplay for a few seconds.
DediMeasureCamera=Select how many measures should the camera wait for the next angle.\n\n(Measures are divided into 4 beats, so keep that in mind when selecting.)
