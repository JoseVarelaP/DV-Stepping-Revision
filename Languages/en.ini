It should give you a song folder.\n\nIf it does, then move that folder inside the 'Songs' folder located on the root directory of your StepMania install.\n\nIn the case of .SMZIP files, then create a folder called 'Packages' and place the .SMZIP file inside that folder.\n\nOnce you're ready, press [ENTER] to Reload Songs and courses.

[OptionExplanations]
SRCredits=Check out who made Project Diva: Stepping Revision possible!
AllowMultipleModels=(CAN CAUSE PERFORMANCE ISSUES)\n\nThis enables the background to load more than one model at a time. Positioning depends on the stage selected.
CurrentStageLighting=Change the setting if the current stage will automaticly cycle during the time of day or manually set it to your liking.
CurrentStageLocation=Select a stage that will be set as the theme's background.\n\n(Locations with (+P) indicate that they might cause perfomance issues.)
ModelsInRoom=Adjust the ammount of models that will appear on the room. You can set a maximum of 5.
DedicatedCharacterShow=Enables the Dedicated Character Show that shows in Gameplay.\n\nIt is extremely experimental right now, and feedback on this feature will be greatly appreciated!
MainCharacterOnHome=Select the character that will shown in front of you in the main menu.
ShowCharactersOnHome=Select if characters should be shown on the Main Menu.
Dedicated Character Settings=Access settings for the Dedicated Character Show in Gameplay.
EnableRandomSongPlay=Enables the theme's ability to pick a random song from your SM Songs library and plays it as the menu's music.\n\nNot the best implementation in the world, but it's ok I guess.
FolderToPlayRandomMusic=Select a folder that it will play its music from.
ShowRandomSongBackground=Choose if the random song's background will softly show up in the menu.\n\nWhen there's no stage or character loaded, it diffuses to half. If there is, then by a forth.
ShowPlayedSongsInFolder=(CAN CAUSE PERFOMANCE ISSUES)\n\nAllows the folders to show a display of songs played / total; including the percentage.\n\nGold folder coloring will still remain regardless of this setting.
DediExpLight=This enables the Lighting fix, which reduces the brightness of the Character during gameplay. This can be useful to fix model material colors from being completely whited out by the max diffuse that is used by default.\n\nKeep in mind that some models that rely more on texture lighting might give graphical issues if this setting is enabled.

ModelRateBPMLow=Set the low BPM neccesary for the Range to hit its lowest.
ModelRateBPMMax=Set the max BPM neccesary for the Range to hit its highest.
ModelRateMulLow=Set the range in which the Model Updater will multiply at in its lowest.
ModelRateMulMax=Set the range in which the Model Updater will multiply at in its maximum.

DediModelBPM=(EXPERIMENTAL)\n\nAllows the model to pause its animation during a stop. This is a little unstable so trying to fast foward or slow down the game freezes the model.
DediSongData=Shows a bit of song info at the beginning of gameplay for a few seconds.
DediMeasureCamera=Select how many measures should the camera wait for the next angle.\n\n(Measures are divided into 4 beats, so keep that in mind when selecting.)

Debug Camera=Allows you to control the camera on the current location with a random character.\n\nIt can be helpful to setup camera locations with the tool.
