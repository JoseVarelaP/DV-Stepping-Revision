Information on Locations

A more detail documentation of this system and how to support your stage, visit:
https://github.com/JoseVarelaP/PD-Stepping-Revision/wiki/Locations

Warnings:
- Make sure the model.txt file for the stage is correctly named and formatted.
- Ensure the materials are correctly set and named to the appropiate material name that is described on the wiki.
- Don't add random symbols to the stage name and folder. StepMania cannot recognize all characters in the world.
- If no Cameras.lua is provided for the Location, Default_Camera.lua is loaded. (PLEASE DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE.)
